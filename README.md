**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS**<br />
This is aimed at understanding the dataset. By visualizing the features we can make assumptions on features that could likely influence housing prices. On face value the I selected the following features to most likely influence housing prices
- Basement, lot and garage size
- Type of utilities available
- Neighbourhood
- Overall quality/condition of house
- Year built
- Sale type
